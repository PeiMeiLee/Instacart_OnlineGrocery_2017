## Project Intro
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. It already has good sales, but the management wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
###### Note: The project intro is excerpted from the project brief document provided by the program.
## Data
The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters:
* Orders
* Products
* Departments
* Aisles
* Customers
###### The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 was accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis). The customer data as well as the “prices” column in the products data set were both fabricated by CareerFoundry for the learning purpose of this course.
  
## Tools
For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn

For fixing errors in my scripts and optimizing my visualizations, I sought assistance from ChatGPT.
