## Background
- Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. It already has good sales, but the management wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
- This project was created for my Data Analytics bootcamp studies at CareerFoundry in 2023.
  
## Data
- 7 CSV files
- 34 columns in total
- Data Dictionary is provided by [jeremystan](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b).

The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters:
* Orders
* Products
* Departments
* Aisles
* Customers
###### Note: The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 was accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis). The customer data as well as the “prices” column in the products data set were both fabricated by CareerFoundry for the learning purpose of this course.

## Project Objectives
- Performing an initial data exploratory analysis to derive insights
- Suggesting strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria
  
## Tools Used
For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
###### For fixing errors in my scripts and optimizing my visualizations, I sought assistance from ChatGPT. 

## Skills Applied
- Using Python to do the following:
  - Wrangling & merging data
  - Grouping & aggregating data
  - Visualizing data
- Using Anaconda libraries manager & Jupyter Notebooks
- Creating a population flowchart
- Creating repositories on GitHub
